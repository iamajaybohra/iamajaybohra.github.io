The planetary system that we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.

Solar

Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

But what would your solar system look like?

In this project, i have build our very own solar system in with the help of simple HTML and A-Frame.
